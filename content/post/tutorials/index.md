**Schedule for FMTea tutorials**
 
In the FME Teaching Committee, we are launching a new tutorial series, planned to be held monthly. We aim to increase the awareness and sharing of tools and techniques used for teaching formal methods. The tutorial will be held online via zoom. We will record (whenever the speaker agrees) these presentations and collect them on the [FME Teaching Committee website](https://fme-teaching.github.io).

If you wish to receive announcements on these lectures, please subscribe to our mailing list fmtea@fmeurope.org by sending an email to sympa@lists.uu.se with the subject line
