**Schedule for FMTea tutorials**
 
In the FME Teaching Committee, we are launching a new tutorial series, planned to be held monthly. We aim to increase the awareness and sharing of tools and techniques used for teaching formal methods. The tutorial will be held online via zoom. We will record (whenever the speaker agrees) these presentations and collect them on the [FME Teaching Committee website](https://fme-teaching.github.io).

## Below you'll find the list of speakers who agreed to share their FM teaching insight.
