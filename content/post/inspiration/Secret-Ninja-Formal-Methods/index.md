## Abstract
The use of formal methods can significantly improve software
quality. However, many instructors and students consider formal meth-
ods to be too difficult, impractical, and esoteric for use in undergraduate
classes. This paper describes a method, used successfully at several uni-
versities, that combines ninja stealth with the latest advances in formal
methods tools and technologies to integrate applied formal methods into
software engineering courses.
