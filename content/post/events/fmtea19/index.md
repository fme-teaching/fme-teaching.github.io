Formal Methods provide software engineering with tools and techniques for
rigorously reasoning about the correctness of systems. While in recent years
formal methods are increasingly being used in industry, university curricula
are not adapting at the same pace. Some existing formal methods classes
interest and challenge students, whereas others fail to ignite student
motivation. We need to find ways to teach formal methods to the next
generation, and doing so will require us to adapt our teaching to the 21st
century students.

FMTea23 is a combined workshop and tutorial at the 25th International Symposium on Formal
Methods, FM2023. Its aim is to share experiences of teaching formal methods
that have gone well, or that failed in surprising ways, as well as to develop
ways to reboot the presence of formal methods in curricula. 


In the workshop part of the event, we aim to attract papers detailing authors’
experiences with FM Teaching. We would like to get papers discussing successes
and failures of various methods, case studies, tools, etc. As self-learning
seems to be an important aspect of FM teaching, we appreciate experiences with
online teaching, including experiences with teaching formal methods via MOOCs.
