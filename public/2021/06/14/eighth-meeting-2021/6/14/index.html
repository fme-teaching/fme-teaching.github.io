<li>Teaching Committee so far: FME has changed the rules of its committees, the length of one term is now 3 years and we are now in our second term.

</ol>
<ul>
<li>FMTea workshop &ndash;&gt; we revived it and it goes very nicely</li>
<li>the Formal Methods courses database &ndash;&gt; as above</li>
<li>we have a nice webpage where we collected many of our thoughts about what this committee should be working on</li>
<li>we have applied (unsuccessfully so far) to a COST action</li>
</ul>
<p>Related to the FME rules, they (vaguely) suggest there should be 4 meetings per year, and we had in average 2 meetings per year, so we might meet once per season if everyone is ok with it</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Alexandra and Joao informed us about FMTea&rsquo;s status</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Tobias Nipkow &ndash;&gt; invited speaker</li>
<li>one more confirmed tutorial speaker</li>
<li>a third tutorial speaker needed &ndash;&gt; we discussed Laura Kovacs and her automated approach to generate personalised exams</li>
<li>submission deadline: July 2</li>
<li>more publicity needed</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>COST application - rejected, but we agreed to try once more; next deadline at the end of October</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>we discussed a bit the comments we received from the reviewers and we will start a new iteration from there
in a separate email we will discuss these comments with the people involved (this meeting summary will go into our webpage, so this is not the place to add the comments)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>What do we do next</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>we decided to start a tutorial series on teaching formal methods &ndash;&gt; thanks Brijesh for the excellent suggestion!
monthly (or every other week, depending on the availability of speakers; we decided to start monthly)
online
<ul>
<li>start with the FMTea19 participants, see if we can convince people to discuss their approaches</li>
<li>record the sessions if the speaker agrees and upload them in the webpage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we need to recheck the courses database, to see if courses are still up to date
<ul>
<li>possibly recheck our countries for FM courses if we get to it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>on the would-be-nice-to-do list</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>organise (establish) a training school
<ul>
<li>main question here: what is the level, beginner or advanced?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>each of us makes a video of our favorite formal method (a la Lamport&rsquo;s teaching of TLA+)</li>
<li>collect interesting papers and materials (we have a section in the webpage for inspiration)</li>
<li>we wanted to collect exams, solutions, case studies (simple ones, as the complex case studies are handled by the Industry Committee; proof-of-concept) &ndash;&gt; we can upload them in the webpage</li>
</ul>
