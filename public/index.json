The recording of Prof. Krishnamurthi\u0026rsquo;s lecture can be seen here. Screenshots from the lecture, as well as the chat window can be checked here. Shriram is involved in teaching 3 formal methods courses at Brown, with audiences varying between 70 and 200 students. In his talk, he discusses the importance of understanding the properties our programs should conform to, the role of unit testing in coding, as well as how students could gain from focusing on the problem to solve before programming a solution to it. Shriram\u0026rsquo;s talk is based on two papers:\n Using Relational Problems to Teach Property-Based Testing (John Wrenn, Tim Nelson, Shriram Krishnamurthi), link here Automated, Targeted Testing of Property-Based Testing Predicates (Tim Nelson, Elijah Rivera, Sam Soucie, Thomas Del Vecchio, Jack Wrenn, Shriram Krishnamurthi), link here    (Thursday!!) April 28, 2022, 3 pm CET: Prof. Jeremy Gibbons (University of Oxford, UK): How to Design Co−Programs. The recording of Prof. Gibbons\u0026rsquo;s lecture can be seen here. A few screenshots from the lecture can be checked here. Prof. Gibbons takes us on a tour of teaching programming to novices and explains that writing a program does not happen by magic. His main thesis is that programs rely heavily on the structure of the input data as well as on that of the output data. This is a refinement to the hypothesis of the classic book, “How to Design Programs” by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi, which supports the idea the the structure of a program should follow the structure of the program\u0026rsquo;s input data. The talk is supported by the paper and slides below:\n How to Design Co−Programs (Jeremy Gibbons). In Journal of Functional Programming. Vol. 31. No. e15. 2021. Link here. Slides here.  The abstract of Prof. Gibbons' lecture is here:\n The observation that program structure follows data structure is a key lesson in introductory programming: good hints for possible program designs can be found by considering the structure of the data concerned. In particular, this lesson is a core message of the influential textbook \u0026ldquo;How to Design Programs\u0026rdquo; by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi. However, that book discusses using only the structure of input data for guiding program design, typically leading towards structurally recursive programs. We argue that novice programmers should also be taught to consider the structure of output data, leading them also towards structurally corecursive programs.\n   June 17, 2022: Dr Tim Nelson (Brown University, US): Building Formal Methods Classes for Everybody. The recording of Dr Nelson\u0026rsquo;s lecture can be seen here. A few screenshots from the lecture can be seen here, together with the chat from the talk. In this talk, Dr. Nelson describes his course, Logic for Systems, which is the first course in Formal Methods at Brown. He argues that, for some students, it will also be the only formal method course they take and discusses ways to make the course have an impact on all students. For instance, all students should understand the notion of invariant and how to prove it. Although not mandatory, the course has in average 135 participants every year! For the final projects, the students can choose freely what system to model and prove properties about: while there are many software-specific systems they choose, there are also projects about chemistry, baseball and basketball, which really shows that students understand that formal methods are universal: they are a tool we use for modeling and proving whatever system!\nThe abstract of Dr Nelson\u0026rsquo;s lecture is here:\n We think math and logic are beautiful and essential. If you teach a formal methods class, you probably agree. Some of our students, perhaps the most visible to us, also feel that way. But what about the other 90%, the students who aren\u0026rsquo;t inclined to take our classes or any non-required \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo; class at all? If formal methods really are essential, we owe every student an opportunity to explore them, discover useful ideas, and maybe even fall in love.\n  Some people derisively respond to a more inclusive class by assuming it will coddle students. On the contrary, these students have their own strengths and abilities that we can and should design rigorous content around. After all, many of them will build the technologies we all use every day, so deepening their view of formalism satisfies both moral and selfish imperatives. This talk will cover the design space of such a course: pedagogy, tool choice (sometimes building our own!), assignment design, and even TA hiring. I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about things that have worked well for us, other things that didn\u0026rsquo;t, and what we learned along the way.\n   July 29, 2022: Prof Erika Abraham (RWTH Aachen University, Germany): Automatic exercise generation for satisfiability checking. The abstract of Prof. Abraham\u0026rsquo;s lecture is here:\n We offer a lecture on satisfiability checking, repeated annually each winter term since 2009. The contents cover SAT solving to check the satisfiability of propositional logic formulas as well as SAT-modulo-theories (SMT) solving for checking the satisfiability of logical formulas over different theories (equality logic with uninterpreted functions, bit-vector arithmetic, linear and nonlinear real and integer arithmetic).\n  This lecture is challenging to teach, as the underlying math is - at least for the arithmetic theories - quite involved. The manual execution of the algorithms by the students plays a substantial role, thus it is important to offer the students a pool of exercises. Furthermore, with more that 500 registered students in the last winter term under pandemic conditions, we needed a large number of individual but comparable exercises for interactions during the lecture as well as for the online exam.\n  However, the automated generation of comparable SMT-solving exercises turned out to be a hard nut. In this talk we discuss the obstacles and propose some solutions.\n   August 26, 2022, 3 pm CEST: Dr Robert Lewis (Brown University, US): Teaching the theory and practice of proof assistants with Lean\n  September 30, 2022, 3 pm CEST: Prof Michael Leuschel (Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Germany): Teaching Formal Methods and Theoretical Computer Science with ProB\n  October 28, 2022, 3 pm CET: Dr Allan Blanchard (CEA-LIST, France)\n  Below you\u0026rsquo;ll find the list of speakers who shared their formal methods teaching insight in 2021:  September 24, 2021, 3pm CET: Prof Sandrine Blazy (University of Rennes 1, France): Why3 tool for deductive program verification. The recording of Prof. Blazy\u0026rsquo;s lecture can be seen here. A few screenshots from the lecture can be seen here. Why3 is an intermediate language used for deductive verification: the user writes a specification, a corresponding program, and uses Why3 to prove that the program satisfies the specification. This is achieved in the background by the tool, by generating verification conditions, using the weakest precondition calculus. Why3 interfaces with numerous (currently about 20) automatic and interactive theorem provers and does not require the user to come up with many assertions, except those validating specifications. Here you can check Why3\u0026rsquo;s website. October 29, 2021, 3pm CET: Dr Ran Ettinger (Ben-Gurion University, Israel): Teaching Cantor\u0026rsquo;s theorem, a pumping lemma, and the derivation of a heapsort algorithm using Dafny. The recording of Dr. Ettinger\u0026rsquo;s lecture can be seen here. A few screenshots from the lecture can be seen here. Ran demonstrates in this lecture a hands-on approach on how to prove mathematical theorems with Dafny, a programming language generally used for verifying the correctness of software. This is a refreshing approach that Ran continues to teach even now when he moved to industry (NVidia). Dafny was initiated by Rustan Leino at Microsoft Research and is now (since Rustan moved to Amazon) maintained by Amazon Web Services. Here is Dafny\u0026rsquo;s github website and here is Dafny\u0026rsquo;s Wikipedia page. November 20-21, 9am-4pm CET: Tutorials@FM21  FMTea videos can be seen from here; FMTea is currently the main workshop on teaching formal methods. FMI videos can be seen from here; FMI is a tutorial about formal methods used in connection with the digital twin concept. Event-B IDE videos can be seen from here; Event-B IDE is a tutorial about developing an IDE for the Event-B language. Momba videos can be seen from here; Momba is a tutorial about quantitative modelling with python.   December 10, 9am CET: Assoc Prof David Pearce (Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand): Teaching Software Verification with Whiley. The recording of Assoc. Prof. Pearce\u0026rsquo;s lecture can be seen here. Screenshots from the lecture as well as the chat with questions can be checked from here. Whiley is a programming language that can be used for verification and it was initiated by David himself. Here is the Wikipedia page for it and here the github page. David\u0026rsquo;s talk is divided into two parts - the first one describing and demonstrating Whiley and the second one offering hints on teaching it.

We have what to learn even from less successful experiences We need more than two reviews per paper – two authors complained about this      Next time though, maybe we allocate 2 days for the workshop\n An alternative would be to only have the workshop and not the tutorial part, but we all agreed that we loved the tutorials as well, and we should keep going with them With 2 days, we could afford to schedule 30 min per paper presentation We’ll see closer to the workshop if we still need the panels 🡪 we could also have more general panels including more than 3-4 papers as we had now    We did not discuss much the poster session; the chairs of the next workshop edition should ponder whether such session it’s needed. We added it more because of the “hard to reject” papers situation\n    We discussed in some details the forthcoming COST application for funding. Here is a summary of these discussions:\n  COST is an European association for funding networking activities of 4-year projects that bring together at least 7 COST countries\n Examples of activities funded  Training schools Short term scientific visits (from 7 days to six months) Conference organization and participation   COST countries  essentially all European countries split into research-challenged countries (ITC – inclusiveness target countries) and research-strong countries (non-ITC) every project proposal has to contain 50% ITC countries   from each country, many participants can adhere international partners are encouraged to participate  they do not get funded as the COST countries partners are participants from the international partners can be funded if they are invited speakers they can host visits from the other participants in the project      The application is double blind, which makes a bit challenging: for instance, we have to argue we have a critical mass of participants to implement the project activities, without saying who we are\n  We can assume about the reviewers that they are not formal methods specialists, so we need to write the application with this in mind\n  A catalyst for a successful proposal is to demonstrate a high impact as well as a sustained focus on supporting early-career investigators (less than 8 years elapsed from their PhD degree)\n  The application consists on a 15-page document focusing on S/T excellence, Networking, Impact and Implementation. There are a few other online forms to fill in as well.\n  Deadline: 29 April\n  The status of our application\n 16 countries  COST Countries (12): Cyprus , Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , France , Italy , Luxembourg , Norway , Portugal , Romania , United Kingdom International Partner Country (4) : Australia , Brazil , Canada , United States   23 proposers (people) ITC rate: 50% (Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania) Gender distribution: 70% males, 30% females Average number of years elapsed since PhD graduation: 20.6 Number of early career investigators: 3 (out of 23) S/T excellence section written, and some Networking section parts Link to Google file distributed so that people can comment and contribute    We should extend our network, so if you know of people who are likely to enjoy joining us, please let Luigia know, so that an invitation is sent to them from the COST system\n Apparently an average COST action has 25 COST countries (although people can join also after the action starts) We would anyway benefit from having more early career investigators We need to keep the 50% balance with ITS countries From this map you can see what countries are ITC (the green ones): https://www.cost.eu/who-we-are/members/      The rest of the items on the agenda remained for a future meeting.\n  ","date":1583280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583280000,"objectID":"396d484dc2957a012f023ecea85ced45","permalink":"/2020/03/04/sixth-meeting-2020/03/04/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2020/03/04/sixth-meeting-2020/03/04/","section":"post","summary":"Present at the meeting: Klaus, Claudio, Rustan, Leila, Catherine, Graeme, Brijesh, Pierluigi, Luigia\nOn the agenda:\n FMTea workshop Overview What went well and what did not Next edition?

We agreed that this is about the rate of many serious funding foundations, and since the submission deadline is on April 29, we should be able to produce a successful application The reviewing of the application will be performed by domain experts (in computer science/formal methods) but the decision is taken by science advisers from the European Commission, so we should make the impact clear We need to propose measures/metrics that can quantify the success of our network. (A network has a timespan of 4 years). We thought about  the number of courses collected in the FME database (54 now) the next editions of the FMTea workshop we had on Monday on formal methods teaching - it was a great success, 45 people registered, many more present at all times, 22 papers submitted and 14 accepted, 3 tutorials, an invited lecture (Carroll Morgan)   At the same time, the main goal of a successful COST application is to show that the proposed network will increase an important scientific/technological aspect of society. We start with the Formal Methods Body-of-Knowledge idea, which is envisioned to lead to formal methods researchers meeting up and creating new material where needed, streamline and refine existing approaches, etc We agreed that sometime in November we will start circulating a version of the proposal and brainstorming ideas. We will create a Google repository with all resources we gathered so far.  We then discussed the adding of various resources to the FME Teaching repository (https://fme-teaching.github.io), such as various tutorials given here during the FM week on various formal methods and tools as well as teaching resources for those of us who teach and need new ideas (midterms, exam questions, exercises, etc)\n","date":1570492800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570492800,"objectID":"c1b840cbbab39f824c00c1b98ca7929b","permalink":"/2019/10/08/fifth-meeting-2019/10/06/","publishdate":"2019-10-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2019/10/08/fifth-meeting-2019/10/06/","section":"post","summary":"Present at the meeting: Catherine Dubois, Kristin Rozier, Alexandra Mendes, João Ferreira, Claudio Menghi, Klaus Havelund, Emil Sekerinski, Brijesh Dongol, Graeme Smith and Luigia Petre.\n We started by a round table introduction of everyone present   We briefly reviewed the slides previously distributed about the current vision of the application and the COST format We checked the current version of the technical annex needed for submission (also previously distributed) It might be the case that a new invitation will be sent for joining the application, since the network seems to have expired at the previous collection deadline (September 5) We discussed the effort/benefit of pursuing the application, given that the acceptance rate is 11%.","tags":[],"title":"Fifth Meeting (2019/10/06)","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Inspiration"],"content":"Link to article: InformalMethods-Morgan.pdf\nAbstract This article describes an experimental course in \u0026ldquo;(In-)Formal Methods\u0026rdquo;, taught for three years at the University of New South Wales to fourth-year undergraduate Computer-Science students.

Second-year students are on their way to the same standard: but many of them have not yet realised how hard it will be actually to get there.\nEither way, whether good or on the way to good, few of these students have even heard of static reasoning, assertions, invariants, variants, let alone have learned how to use them. . . None of the simple, yet profoundly important intellectual programming tools first identified and brought to prominence (more than 40 years ago) has become part of their program- ming toolkit.\nWhy did this happen? How can it be changed?\nWhat will happen if we do change it?\nBelow we address some of those questions, using as examples actual material from the two related courses mentioned above; they were given in the years 2010–4. As an appendix, we present feedback from some of the students who took one course or the other.\nAt the same time, some suggestions are made about whether, when and how courses like this one could possibly be taught elsewhere.\n","date":1570100712,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570100712,"objectID":"42655253ee716c93569030863c57a457","permalink":"/2019/10/03/in-formal-methods-the-lost-art-a-users-manual/","publishdate":"2019-10-03T12:05:12+01:00","relpermalink":"/2019/10/03/in-formal-methods-the-lost-art-a-users-manual/","section":"post","summary":"by Carroll Morgan, 2016","tags":[],"title":"(In-)Formal Methods: The Lost Art --- A Users’ Manual","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Events"],"content":"FMTea 2019 Website: https://fmtea.github.io\nFormal Methods provide software engineering with tools and techniques for rigorously reasoning about the correctness of systems.

Present at this meeting: Rustan Leino (US, Seattle), Catherine Dubois (France, Paris), Pierluigi Sanpietro (Italy, Milano), Luigia Petre (Finland, Turku), Kenji Taguchi (Japan, Kyoto), Graeme Smith (New Zealand).\nBernd Fisher stepped down the committee as he became head of his department at Stellenbosch University, in South Africa.\nWe had two points to discuss at this meeting:\n The FMTea19 workshop webpage and call for papers (CfP), to be released soon The course repository – future changes  Point 1 There were no suggestions for the webpage update, except to include the tutorial programme as soon as we can. The tutorial program is quite stable at this point, having the following main structure:\n   Time Talk     9-10 Carroll Morgan (invited talk)   10-10.45 Tony Hoare (foundations talk)   10.45-11.15 Break   11.15-12 Holger Hermanns (tutorial on teaching concurrency with pseuCo.com) https://depend.cs.uni-saarland.de/~hermanns/, https://pseuco.com/#/landing   12-12:45 Bas Luttik (tutorial on online teaching Logic and Set Theory) https://www.win.tue.nl/~luttik/index.shtml    Regarding the first paragraph of the CfP, Rustan suggested it is abit too gloomy, at least from the industry’s point of view. Graeme argued that the situation is however far from pink in universities. So Rustan wrote a new beginning of the CfP proposal, which at least I like very much.\nOld version:  “Teaching Formal Methods is an important aspect of the Formal Methods world, as it invests in the future of Formal Methods (FM). However, in many universities around the world, Formal Methods courses have decreased in number and/or content, have been transformed into (smaller) postgraduate courses, or have been kept only as self-study courses for truly motivated students. Even in universities where the courses have remained intact in the curriculum, the attendance and motivation of the students is sometimes challenging. This happens at the same time as the need for Formal Methods has in fact increased proportionally with the ubiquity of software and microchips in all aspects of our lives. We need to find ways to teach Formal Methods to the next generation, but we obviously need to adapt our teaching to the 21st century’s students. We will explore these ideas in FMTea19, a combined workshop and tutorial associated with the 3rd World Congress on Formal Methods, FM2019.”\n New proposal:  “Formal Methods provide software engineering with tools and techniques for rigorously reasoning about the correctness of systems. While in recent years formal methods are increasingly being used in industry, university curricula are not adapting at the same pace. Some existing formal methods classes interest and challenge students, whereas others fail to ignite student motivation. We need to find ways to teach formal methods to the next generation, and doing so will require us to adapt our teaching to 21st century students. FMTea19 is a combined workshop and tutorial at the 3rd World Congress on Formal Methods, FM2019. Its aim is to share experiences of teaching formal methods that have gone well, or that failed in surprising ways, as well as to develop ways to reboot the presence of formal methods in curricula.”\n Point 2 About the course repository, the opinions were unanimous that we should choose the format proposed by Alexandra and Joao. They have revived a 10-year old database of formal methods courses (117 courses) and discovered that only 20 are still alive:\n Old database: https://jff.github.io/fme-teaching/courses_all/ Only 20 courses out of 117 are still active: https://jff.github.io/fme-teaching/courses_live/  They have also re-written our current repository in their format: https://jff.github.io/fme-teaching/\nThe proposal is to move to this new format, but to find a way to add the university, country and teaching year. We should also find a way of re-organizing the topics, as right now every course has its own topics basically. And we should be able to search based on everything (teacher, country, etc). If possible :-)\nGraeme observed that, when clicking on the course taught by Jeff Sanders (Application Oriented Program Semantics), this leads to an alphabetical list of courses at Oxford. This course seems to have disappeared. The same with Domain theory. I have clicked on other Oxford courses and it’s the same: Lambda Calculus leads to the same alphabetical list of courses, and when searching for the course, I found that it’s not A. Ker who teaches it anymore, but somebody else who uses the lecture notes of A. Ker. The webpage for “Formal Methods for Software Engineering” is also gone. So maybe we should check them once more. Finally, we should implement a way of checking annually if courses are still alive. Maybe collect all contacts in a group email, or something in that direction.\n","date":1554163200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554163200,"objectID":"0ca89a1c3949bc41107eea5bb8964018","permalink":"/2019/04/02/fourth-meeting-2019/04/02/","publishdate":"2019-04-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2019/04/02/fourth-meeting-2019/04/02/","section":"post","summary":"As we are all over the world, for some the (skype) meeting took place on April 2nd and for some on April 3rd.

We have thought on how to store our repository of courses. Dino and Bernd mentioned ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net) and Researchr (https://researchr.org/), but in the end we agreed to give GitHub a try. GitHub is primarily a tool for storing and sharing code, but other repositories can be formed, for instance all the papers published on a topic, check the Github repository for reaction systems: https://github.com/RS-Repo/library. The papers are now stored as “Issues”, and Rustan made a good point in that maybe we should investigate whether the Wiki menu is more appropriate. Bernd thought the “Issues” might offer better measurability. We agreed to investigate this.\n  Courses we found. Graeme sent FM courses he uncovered in Australia and New Zealand. It’s quite nice to see our first courses collected! In particular, New Zealand seems strong! Graeme made these lists by individually emailing people he knew from a forum called “Formal Methods Australia” and from other sources. The response was great, and people commented on how teaching in Formal Methods decreased and how they are quite interested in our actions, wanting to follow and contribute if possible.\n  FMBoK. No new developments so far and we agreed we have to start from somewhere. Bernd proposed the ACM classification of terms (http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2380000/2371137/ACMCCSTaxonomy.html?ip=105.226.111.82\u0026amp;id=2371137\u0026amp;acc=OPEN\u0026amp;key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437\u0026amp;__acm__=1527107802_08980bfd5d30a9c8c73731f196803528) also check this link https://www.acm.org/about-acm/class. We should also check the FMBoK efforts of Jonathan Bowen, Kenji Taguchi and others, sent as links and references in a previous email. I re-attach the file to this email for easier handling. We could also check the Software Engineering BoK for reference.\n  Other advances on repositories. Not yet. In addition to what we agreed to store in repos last time though (case studies, simpler and more complex and exam questions), Graeme pointed out that resources on how to teach formal methods are quite valuable as well. A first paper to check on this topic was “(In)formal methods: the lost art” by Carroll Morgan, 2016, link here:\n  @inproceedings{DBLP:conf/setss/Morgan14, author = {Carroll Morgan}, title = {(In-)Formal Methods: The Lost Art - {A} Users' Manual}, booktitle = {Engineering Trustworthy Software Systems - First International School, {SETSS} 2014, Chongqing, China, September 8-13, 2014.

We agreed on GoogleDocs, at least for the time being.\n  Other issues. The issue of taking advantage of the Formal Methods community arose and we discussed how we can obtain info on FM courses from people we will anyway meet at FM conference in Oxford, at Formalise in Götenborg, Sweden, at ABZ in Southampton, etc. We agreed that maybe we ask the chairs to inform participants of our committee and to create some handouts for people to fill in wrt FM courses they know about. Rustan made a good point that it is interesting to see how FM teaching evolves over time, for instance to also ask questions like “what tool do you use to teach model checking”.\n  Next steps. This is how we continue.\n   Luigia creates a repository in github and adds the courses sent by Graeme there. We then think whether we are happy with this storing mechanism or not. We all check the ACM classification and the previous work on FMBoK and come up with proposals on how to revive this initiative. Luigia copies all our materials to GoogleDocs and so we’ll have a sharing mechanism We make a format for what to ask people about (in emails or in handouts at conferences) wrt FM courses We meet again in September, Luigia sends Doodle poll at the end of August\u0026hellip;  ","date":1527033600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527033600,"objectID":"707e3566aa840e1be81899587bd9db5c","permalink":"/2018/05/23/second-meeting-2018/05/23/","publishdate":"2018-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2018/05/23/second-meeting-2018/05/23/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome back!

Luigia Petre  Working with Action Systems and Event-B at Åbo Akademi University in Turku, Finland. Currently on sabbatical at University of South Florida in Tampa, US. Originally from Romania. Been involved in organising several formal methods conferences. In the process of changing my teaching profile, but have taught before courses on Software Architecture, Networks, Approximation and Randomised Algorithms. Interested in integrating formal methods.   Rustan Leino Leila Ribeiro Alexandra Mendes Joao Ferreira Catherine Dubois  I work at ENSIIE, a computer science engeneering school in France, near Paris. My research topics concern deductive formal methods and currently I am very much i interested in interoperability of provers. I teach formal methods in different courses. The first course is a brief introduction to reasoning about programs (Hoare logic, Frama-C WP), the rest of the course being about testing. A second course (42 hours) is about B and refinement and application to security (access control policies). And a last course (again 42 hours) concerns Coq, type theory and formal semantics. I also teach an introduction to abstract interpretation in a master course.   Dino Mandrioli  I am at Politcnico di Milano I teach a basic course on theoretical computer science and algorihms (automata, languages, computatbility, complexity, fundamental algorithms) at the undergraduate level and a Formal methods for concurrent and real-time systems one (Hoare method, timed Petri nets, logic proofs, industrial case studies) for graduate students. As for research, my group developed the logic language TRIO for the specificaion and verification of real-time systems and applied it in various industrial cooperations. Recently, we addressed our efforts towards innnovative techniques to empower model checking.   Bernd Fisher Kenji Taguchi Graeme Smith  I work at the University of Queensland, Australia. I currently research in the area of formal verification of concurrent programs, and have an ongoing collaboration with John Derrick at the University of Sheffield, UK. I also teach formal methods in 2 courses. The first course is an introduction to reasoning about programs. I cover Hoare logic and use the KeY tool to allow students to perform program verification on a simple while-language in the first part of the course, and on Java programs (using JML as the specification language) later in the course. The course also introduces weakest preconditions and the refinement calculus. The second course is on concurrent programming. It is not primarily a formal methods course, but I do teach the students how to use the Spin model checker to check properties of simple concurrent code    We wanted to set up the focus of this teaching committee. At least we have identified the following directions we would like to focus on   Database of formal methods courses  we will start from the 2004 database that Jose Nuno Oliveira has compiled Alexandra and Joao will scan the database to prune it of old courses no longer active and they will have a version of it in GitHub where everyone will be able to upload courses in the meantime everyone should collect courses that they think qualify as formal methods courses; we leave it at the discretion of each of us as to what qualifies and what not; for instance there are programming courses with only some invariants that could also be good to add now in the beginning, and maybe we store them under a distinct section while we collect these courses, we can also think if the database we now have needs some extensions, maybe we need some extra information stored for each course, so that we easily find information given some search terms   Repository of examples and case studies on using formal methods  this we felt would be very good to have and sadly missing right now, from the simple examples that one can use in class for explaining simple things to the more complex case studies that really show the potential of various methods there is GitHub for software and BioModels for biological case studies; there is even the Archive of Formal Proofs for Isabelle models, but not for formal methods in general we need a strategy for designing it and then we will start populating it; any ideas here?   Body of Knowledge on Formal Methods  we have a starting point here, led by Kenji Taguchi, Jonathan Bowen, and others need to study it and start adding to it there are some links in the attached word doc to what exists now   Repository of exercises and exam questions on formal methods (under lock, to be released by their authors for fellow-teachers when needed, ie not for students)  this should be similar to the repository of case studies in principle, so when we design one, we have the other too, with the exception of securing the exam questions   List of summer/winter schools on formal methods  Marktoberdorf, yearly: https://asimod.in.tum.de/2017/index.shtml or the wikipedia link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_School_Marktoberdorf Bertinoro: http://www.sti.uniurb.it/events/sfm16quanticol/ SRI: (Rustan mentioned) Tallinn: (Rustan mentioned, Bernd concurred) UK: Midlands China: Ian Hayes speaker  http://www.swu-rise.net.cn/SETSS2017/   Petter Miller in Zurich in autumn (Rustan mentioned) Betrand Meyer on Elba (Rustan mentioned) Laser Summer School. It is larger than formal methods. ISoLa? (Rustan mentioned) DeepSpec  https://deepspec.org/event/dsss18/      “FME Approved” courses - we need to discuss this more   FME is a professional society, so we could take advantage of this Organising certification (and curricula) might be difficult, we should focus on a lighter objective; keep this on our minds  We don’t plan anything at the moment for FM in Oxford, we will maybe send some info later on   Someone mentioned getting a 2-minute slot to promote what we are doing. This might be a way to help get the database(s) populated. We discussed about having online forms to distribute so that we get input from other people too  We will have the next meeting in May, Luigia sends a Doodle poll searching for a reasonable date for everyone. In the meantime we keep in touch via email.
